THEME-
Our game world is literally made up of several tiny planets that the player jumps between (similar to Mario Galaxy or Ratchet and Clank: A Crack in Time). In this way, the game has several tiny worlds making up the game world.

There are many elusive bugs that havenâ€™t been ironed out. If you encounter something game-breaking, restarting the game should be enough to fix it.
